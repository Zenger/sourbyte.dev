I recently discovered you can use ChatGPT to visualize and share dreams. It is a wonderful thing to actually see something that seems like a memory in plain view.
This is an AI image of a dream I had, in my mind the whole world is engulfed in water similar to the movie "Water World" or "Kamino" planet from Star Wars, except in my dream there is just one single structure similar to an oil rig that that hosts the whole world on it. I dont know why, but I wanted to document this memory and share it.

And this is a different one I like that the AI took the liberty to add ships and add a little more life into it.
